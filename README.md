## Description*
Weather applications prove to be very useful when planning for the day. Weather applications can help you decide how to dress appropriately for the day, which activities can be performed.

For example, if you want to have a picnic with your family, it would not be good if that was a rainy day. Another scenario where it could be helpful is if you are going to travel somewhere, knowing the weather at the destiny location can help you pack only the necessary clothing and other things.
